name: job-guardian
description: Use to babysit a long-running process (training run, batch job, migration, deploy) on a remote pod or locally while the user is away. Defines a launch contract, gates on immediate crash, polls for stability, triages anomalies as recoverable (fix + resume) or not (tear down + notify). Auto-triggers when the user asks you to launch a job and watch it / keep it alive / shut it down if it dies.

# Job Guardian

You are taking custody of a process the user will not be watching. Their trust is: it runs to completion, or it dies cleanly and you tell them why — never silently burning a pod for hours on a job that crashed in minute two.

**Iron law:** silence is not success. You confirm liveness and progress by reading evidence (log growth, metrics, exit codes), never by assuming. A poll that returns "still no error" is not the same as "still making progress."

## Away by default

Assume the user is gone the moment they hand you the job — before launch, during the run, after teardown. You do not ask questions, ever. Not at intake, not mid-flight, not at the end. This skill runs under the `handsoff` contract: infer the contract from context, take the safest reversible path, never invent a value where none exists, and log every choice for one end-of-task review.

- **Never ask a question.** Not even at intake. If a required fact has a conservative reading from context, use it and log the choice. If it has none, do not guess (handsoff no-default rule).
- **Structural blocker before launch → stop, don't launch.** Log it under `### Deferred (needs user input)` and notify. A pod you didn't start costs nothing; a job launched on a guessed config can burn hours.
- **Ambiguity while running → take the reversible side.** Pause/checkpoint over kill, `stop` over destroy, keep-alive over a recovery you're unsure of. When unsure whether an action is reversible, assume it isn't.
- **Tell the user at the end.** Surface the decision log and any deferred items in the terminal notification + written record (Phase 5). That review replaces the questions you didn't ask.

## When to invoke

Any process that outlives a single foreground command and will run while the user is away or asleep:
- Remote training run / sweep on a rented pod (RunPod, vast.ai, Lambda)
- Long batch / data pipeline, migration, backfill, eval harness
- Any "launch it and shut it down if it dies" request

For remote work, also read `remote-ssh` (nohup launch, log redirection, connection reuse). For training specifically, `ml-experiments` owns the pre-launch checks — run those first; this skill takes over once the job is live.

## Phase 0 — Contract (before launching anything)

You cannot guard a process whose health you can't define. Derive these from what the user gave you and the repo (their instructions, configs, `train.py`, env, prior runs), per Away by default.

<required>
1. **Launch command** — exact command, working dir, env. Take it as the user wrote it (handsoff rigid path); never reword it into something "equivalent." Output must be captured to a file (GPC5; never run-then-grep).
2. **Liveness signal** — how you know it's still running (PID alive, container up, log mtime advancing).
3. **Health signal** — how you know it's making *progress*, not just alive: step count climbing, loss finite and trending, throughput > 0, rows written increasing. A hung process is alive but not healthy. If the log gives no progress signal you can read, that's a structural blocker — say so before launch, don't guess one.
4. **Done signal** — what successful completion looks like (exit 0, "training complete", checkpoint N saved, expected row count).
5. **Recovery playbook** — for each failure you can anticipate, the fix. (OOM → lower batch size / grad-accum; transient network/NCCL → retry; NaN loss → restart from last checkpoint; disk full → clean + resume.) Anything not on this list is unrecoverable by default — escalate, don't improvise.
6. **Teardown command** — the exact command to release resources. Asking this skill to "shut it down if it dies" authorizes the *reversible* teardown — `runpodctl stop pod <id>` (pausable, keeps the disk). It does NOT authorize destroying state: no `remove pod` / terminate unless the user named that command explicitly. When in doubt, stop, don't destroy.
7. **Budget / stop conditions** — max wall-clock or spend, max recovery attempts per failure class. If the user gave a number, use it. If not, this is a no-default value — don't invent a cap; default the *behavior* to the safe side (on repeated unexplained failure, stop + tear down rather than restart-loop) and log that you had no explicit budget.
8. **Notify-on** — terminal events that pull the user back: done, torn down, gave up. Routine progress does not.
</required>

### Contract file (mandatory)

Always write the contract to a file before launch — no exceptions, even for "quick" jobs. The file is what a fresh session (or the user at 7am) reads to know what you committed to; skipping it means the run is unguarded the moment this session compacts or dies.

- Path: `docs/jobs/<slug>.md`. If a task file exists for this work, append the contract there instead under `## Job guardian contract`.
- Contents: all 8 contract items above, the launch timestamp, PID/container id once known, log path, and the two handsoff lists (`### Hands-off decisions`, `### Deferred (needs user input)`).
- Do not launch until the file is written. The file is the gate.

**Keep the file live.** Any time the instructions change — user sends new guidance, you revise the recovery playbook, budget shifts, teardown command updates, a deferred item gets resolved — update the file immediately and log the change under `### Hands-off decisions` with a timestamp. The file is the single source of truth for the contract; if it disagrees with what you're actually doing, the file wins or you fix it.

## Phase 1 — Setup

Do the prep the job needs, idempotently (GPC5): env / deps installed, data and checkpoints in place, output dir and log path created, secrets present (`.env`, never hardcoded). Verify the launch command exists and is runnable *before* committing to it. For remote: confirm the pod is reachable and connection multiplexing is up (`remote-ssh`).

## Phase 2 — Launch + crash gate

Launch with output redirected to the log file. Then **do not leave** until you've cleared the immediate-crash window — most failures (bad path, OOM on first batch, import error, auth) surface in the first minutes.

<required>
1. Launch; record PID / container id and the log path.
2. Watch the first 1–5 min actively (a `Monitor` on the log tail, or a few short-interval reads). Wait for the *health* signal to fire at least once — first step logged, first batch through, first rows written — not merely "no error yet."
3. If it crashed or never reached the health signal: triage now (Phase 4). Do not start the long poll on a job that never got off the ground.
4. Only once you've seen real progress: declare stable and enter Phase 3.
</required>

A `Monitor` over the log is the natural crash gate — but its filter must match failure signatures, not just the success marker, or a crashloop reads as silence:

```
ssh pod 'tail -f /workspace/run.log' | grep -E --line-buffered \
  'step=|loss=|Traceback|Error|CUDA|OOM|Killed|FAILED|assert|NaN'
```

## Phase 3 — Stability poll loop

Now poll on a cadence. Each tick is a real check, not a heartbeat:

<required>
1. Read fresh evidence: tail the log, check PID/container, pull the latest metric.
2. Classify: progressing / done / anomaly. Progress means the health signal advanced *since last tick* — same step count after 5 min is a hang, treat as anomaly.
3. Progressing → schedule the next tick, say nothing.
4. Done → Phase 5 (tear down if the user wants the resource released; notify).
5. Anomaly → Phase 4.
6. Each tick, check budget/stop conditions. Hit one → stop, tear down per contract, notify.
</required>

### Poll mechanics

The harness cannot notify you about remote pod state — you must re-wake yourself. Two ways:

- `ScheduleWakeup` re-wakes this session on a delay. The user's "every 5–10 min" maps to **270s** — just under the 5-min prompt-cache TTL, so each tick stays cheap. (Picking 300s pays the cache miss without buying a longer wait; see the ScheduleWakeup guidance.) Use a longer fallback delay (1200s+) only when nothing changes that fast.
- `Monitor` (persistent) pushes log lines to you as events — good for tight watching of an active log, with a filter covering progress *and* failure signatures (above). For an ephemeral remote pod where the SSH tail can drop, prefer `ScheduleWakeup` polling as the durable mechanism and use `Monitor` only as an additive watch.

Don't block the session on long foreground `sleep`s. Schedule the next tick and yield.

## Phase 4 — Triage: recoverable or not

Match the failure against the Phase 0 playbook. Fail fast and loud (GPC6) — a wrong recovery that corrupts a checkpoint is worse than a clean stop.

Recoverable (on the playbook, under the attempt cap):
1. Apply the named fix.
2. Resume from the last good checkpoint if the job supports it; else restart.
3. Re-run the Phase 2 crash gate — confirm the fix actually took and progress resumed before trusting it.
4. Increment the attempt counter for this failure class.

Unrecoverable — escalate, do not improvise — when any holds:
- Not on the playbook, or root cause is unclear.
- Attempt cap for this failure class is hit (don't loop a restart forever).
- It needs a human decision (config change, code fix, data problem, budget call).
- Repeated identical crashes — restarting a deterministic failure just burns money.

On unrecoverable: capture the failure (last log lines, error, what you tried), then go to Phase 5.

## Phase 5 — Terminal: teardown + notify

<required>
1. Preserve outputs first — pull checkpoints, logs, results off the pod *before* any teardown, in case teardown destroys the disk.
2. Release the resource (done, gave up, budget hit) with the reversible teardown (`stop`, not destroy). Verify it actually released (pod stopped) — a teardown you didn't confirm is not done (GPC5).
3. Write the record: outcome, final metrics or error, recovery actions taken, where logs/checkpoints live, plus the two handsoff lists — `### Hands-off decisions` (every inferred choice, one line each) and `### Deferred (needs user input)`.
4. `PushNotification` on the contracted terminal events, lead with what the user acts on: `"train done: 50k steps, loss 1.8, pod stopped"`, `"job died — OOM, 3 restarts failed, pod stopped, log saved"`. Not routine progress.
</required>

## Never

- Declare stable from "no error yet" without seeing the health signal fire.
- Read a metric once and assume it's still true an hour later — re-read each tick.
- Restart a deterministic crash past the attempt cap.
- Destroy a pod (`remove`/terminate) the user didn't explicitly name — `stop` ends the spend reversibly.
- Tear down a pod holding the only copy of checkpoints/logs before pulling them off.
- Ask the user anything — at intake, mid-flight, or at teardown. They're away. Infer + log, or defer + stop.
- Launch without the contract file written. No file, no launch.
- Let the contract file drift from current instructions — update it the moment guidance changes.
- Burn budget on a hung job because liveness ≠ progress.
- Block the session on long foreground sleeps instead of `ScheduleWakeup`.
